## --- QUESTIONS ---

Q where does the first admin come from? 
A just copy from the npm registry.
(don't support creating new admins yet)

--- create registry PUT /subdomain/user

copy user (if havn't already), (will need to update the user if it's changed... just replicate all _users)?
create new database,
add the new user as admin,
couchapp push.

FAIL IF: subdomain is already in use, or if user does not exist in npm.

--- add user

copy user (if havn't already),
add the new user as a reader for that database. (this will fail the user is not an admin)

--- remove user

auth as admin
#leave the user there
remove the user as reader on that database.
